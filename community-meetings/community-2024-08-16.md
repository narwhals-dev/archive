## New topics




- Zach Lo introduced himself and told us about his work both as an artist and community developer team manager
- As we are able to test cuDF only on Kaggle, we are interested in how we could test cuDF in our CI/CD, hoping Zach could help us to get in touch with Cuda and Rapids teams.
- We discussed possible events that could host Narwhals Open Source Sprint, for example PyLadies Con, PyData Paris.
- We casually discussed the idea of hackathons and maybe it would be a nice idea to organize one ourselves








## Action items




- Getting in touch with Cuda and Rapids teams
- Submitting OS Sprint proposal to PyData Paris
